isengard project


## Running
* To run:

1. transfer gas to the coz account on your local instance
2. deploy the smart contract to the network
3. Refer to the tests directory for use. `props.puppet` requires a deploy invocation before use.
4. reference the sdk tests to use the abstracted methods.  More will be added as the project matures.

## Bootstrap Todo:
* CI for testing
* auto setup and deployment script
* Contract Unit Tests
* Bootstrap react app
* dice prop needs a generic `randbetween()`
